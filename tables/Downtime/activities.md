title: Downtime Activities

A guide on what you can do with your downtime.

## Lifestyle Expenses

While some downtime activities allow you to circumvent this cost, if you don't plan on doing anything with your downtime, you will be required to pay this cost in order to afford lodging, food, and the maintaining of armor and weapons.

| Lifestyle    | Price per Day |
| :----------- | :------------ |
| Wretched     | -             |
| Squalid      | 1 sp          |
| Poor         | 2 sp          |
| Modest       | 1gp           |
| Comfortable  | 2 gp          |
| Weatlthy     | 4 gp          |
| Aristocratic | 10 gp minimum |

Alternatively, if you have proficiency in the **Survival** skill, you are able to live a comfortable life in the wild but cannot do any other activity. If you are a member or a friend of a guild or group, you may be able to live there without paying the expense as well.

Depending on the lifestyle you chose, you could gain important contacts or connections with other people. Spending time living with the poor might net you allies with the local beggars and street urchins or living an aristocratic life could help you gain favor with a wealthy noble.

## Practicing a Profession (PHB)

Practicing a profession allows you to live a modest lifestyle without paying the cost as long as you keep working. If you are apart of a guild or group, like a thieves guild, you instead gain enough for a comfortable lifestyle. Finally, if your character is willing to put themselves out there and has a proficiency in performance, they can perform and maintain a wealthy lifestyle without paying the cost.

## Building a Stronghold (DMG)

A character can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within a kingdom or similar domain, the character will need a royal charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to the character for as long as he or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or other means.

Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, if it can be bought at all.

Once the estate is secured, a character needs access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the amount of time it takes, provided that the character is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while the character is away, but each day the character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.

| Stronghold              | Construction Cost | Construction Time |
| ----------------------- | ----------------: | ----------------: |
| Abbey                   |         50,000 gp |          400 days |
| Guildhall, town or city |          5,000 gp |           60 days |
| Keep or small castle    |         50,000 gp |          400 days |
| Noble estate with manor |         25,000 gp |          150 days |
| Outpost or fort         |         15,000 gp |          100 days |
| Palace or large castle  |        500,000 gp |        1,200 days |
| Temple                  |         50,000 gp |          400 days |
| Tower, fortified        |         15,000 gp |          100 days |
| Trading post            |          5,000 gp |           60 days |

## Buying a Magical Item (XGtE)

## Carousing (DMG)

Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps them cope with the perils they face on their adventures.

A carousing character spends money as though maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook). At the end of the period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile dice and adds the character's level, then compares the total to the Carousing table to determine what happens to the character, or you choose.

|                  01-10 | You are jailed for 1d4 days at the end of the downtime period on charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. You can pay a fine of 10 gp to avoid jail time, or you can try to resist arrest.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

You decide how you offended them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

You determine the identity of the love interest, subject to your DM's approval. If the romance ends badly, you might gain a new flaw. If it ends well or is ongoing, your new love interest might represent a new bond. |

## Carousing (XGtE)

Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern?

### Resources

Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.

A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.

### Resolution

After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Carousing table.

| Check Total | Result                                    |
| ----------: | :---------------------------------------- |
|         1—5 | Character has made a hostile contact.     |
|        6—10 | Character has made no new contacts.       |
|       11—15 | Character has made an allied contact.     |
|       16—20 | Character has made two allied contacts.   |
|         21+ | Character has made three allied contacts. |

Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.

Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.

Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.

Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.

Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.

You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.

Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.

Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.

The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.

At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit—only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.

### Complications

Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. As a rule of thumb, a character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek of carousing.
